- what: Create public repo skeleton (Makefile, metrics schema, LOG.md, src layout, data/seeds placeholder).
- result: Starter files on GitHub main; `make smoke` target added.
- next: Data Engineer copies seeds onto main; ML Engineer lib smoke after registration confirmed.

- 2026-11-06 (IST): Canonical clone is /workspace/hinglish-shield (see WORKSPACE.md). Scratch venvs at /workspace/hinglish-shield-scratch. Seed PR #1 open.

- what: Expand metrics schema to Experiment Protocol fields; add eval stubs (judges, metrics_io, run_baseline), configs/eval/*.yaml, docs/EVAL_PLAN.md; mark runs/_example as artifact_kind=fixture with null metrics.
- result: Schema + example validate; smoke passes with jsonschema; baseline CLI refuses when curated datasets missing (no invented scores). StrongREJECT note: dsbowen/strong_reject only.
- next: Data freeze HS-Harm/HS-Benign; RUNTIME-VERIFY WildGuard GuardJudge after HF gate; open eval/metrics-schema-stubs PR for Lead Architect review.
